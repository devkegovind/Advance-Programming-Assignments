Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n","<h4 align='justify'>There are mainly two types of data files -- text file and binary file. A text consist of file human readable characters, which can be opened by any text editor. On the other hand, binary files are made up of non-human readable characters and symbols, which require specific programs to access its contents.</h4>  "],"metadata":{"id":"nXM9LbazyIAq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h4 align='justify'><b>\n","Q2. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files\n","</b></h4>\n","<h4 align='justify'>Text files include small size and verasatility. kilobytes or megabytes smaller than the same data stored in other formats, they can be rapidly and massively exchanged via email or disk. Most can be opened on computers running diverse operating systems, using very basic software. Binary files is that they are more efficients. In terms of memory, storing values using numeric formats, rather than as text characters, tends to use less memory. In addition, binary formats also offer advantages in terms of speed of access.</h4>"],"metadata":{"id":"zx10EXyBzTvp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h4 align='justify'><b>\n","Q3.

When do you think you&#39;ll use the struct package the most?</b></h4>\n","<h4 align='justify'>The struct package is mostly used while converting a common python types into 'C' language types. This is done by packing python variables into data fields of specific size. So, when we try read, right number of bytes are read. This useful when interacting with existing binary files.
