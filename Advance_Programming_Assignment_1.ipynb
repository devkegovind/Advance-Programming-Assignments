It is also, an approach used for creating neat and reusable code instead of a redundant one. The program is divided into self-contained objects or several mini-programs. Every individual object represents a different part of the application having its own logic and data to communicate within themselves. Now, to get a more clear picture of why we use oops.</h4>\n",

That makes methods entirely the same as functions, and leaves the actual name to use up to you(although self is the convenction, and people will generally frown at you when you use something else.) self is not special to the code, it's just another object.</h4>"
